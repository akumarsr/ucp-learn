   
   ## UCP Architecture Understanding
   UCP, which stands for Unified Control Plane, serves as the central hub for managing and orchestrating an enterprise's service deployment. Within this control plane, essential tasks include establishing configuration baselines, provisioning user and role access, and hosting applications to enable their seamless execution alongside associated services.

   The same framework can also be employed to deploy infrastructure using Crossplane.

   **What is Crossplane?**
   Crossplane is an open source control plane framework supported by the cloud-native community.
   Crossplane has been endorsed by some of the world's best companies and is released under the Apache 2.0 license. 

   More details refer to the [Crossplane](https://www.crossplane.io/ "Crossplane Official website")

   **Why opt for Crossplane when constructing control planes?**

   **Declarative Configuration**: Crossplane facilitates the creation of control planes with Kubernetes-style declarative and API-driven configuration and management for various resources. This approach ensures that applications and infrastructure managed within your control plane possess inherent self-healing capabilities.

   **Unified Configuration**: Crossplane enables the convergence of application and infrastructure configurations within the same control plane. This simplifies your toolchains and deployment pipelines, reducing complexity.

   **Single Source of Truth**: Control planes constructed using Crossplane seamlessly integrate with CI/CD pipelines. This enables teams to produce, monitor, and approve changes while adhering to GitOps best practices with help of pull base CD tool like Flux and ArgoCD .

   **Automation through Reconciliation**: Your control planes comprise multiple controllers, each responsible for managing the complete lifecycle of a cloud and on-prem resource. These controllers handle provisioning, health monitoring, scaling, failover, and real-time response to external deviations from the desired configuration.

   **High Extensibility**: Crossplane-based control planes leverage well-established Kubernetes design and patterns, making them effortlessly extendable by incorporating custom APIs and controllers. This enhances flexibility and security by embedding policies, quotas, and permissions into custom definitions.

   **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Crossplane allows for the incorporation of organizational concepts and policies at the API level. This grants customers the freedom to self-service within the predefined boundaries of the control plane APIs.

   In summary, Crossplane bridges the gap between open-source capabilities and enterprise-grade control plane needs."

   **UCP** is structured into distinct layers:

   > **Layer 1 - Kubernetes Runtime**: Handles critical functions such as event monitoring, reconciliation, management of Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), OpenAPI, data persistence (etcd), Ingress handling, RBAC enforcement, and workload execution.

   > **Layer 2 - Crossplane Runtime**: Manages interactions with external APIs, encompassing resource creation, updates, and deletions.
   
   > **Layer 3 - Providers**: Establishes connections with cloud APIs to enable the provisioning and management of cloud resources.
   
   > **Layer 4 - Configurations**: Composes customized domain-specific APIs, empowering the management of resources and configurations with fine-grained control.

   **UCP** Leverages **ArgoCD** to continuously observe changes in the infrastructure and assists in seamlessly syncing these changes back to a Git repository.

  **Platform Team in UCP**
  The platform team is responsible for developing and managing the Composite ResourcDefinition(XRD) and compositions of managed resources to meet enterprise security and other governance requirements.

  **Azure Provider Configration**

  ```
  apiVersion: azure.upbound.io/v1beta1
  kind: ProviderConfig
  metadata:
    name: azure
    namespace: crossplane-system
    annotations:
      provider.platform.volvocars.com/external-name: azure-provider
    labels:
      environment:  development
      provider: azure
  spec:
    credentials:
      source: Secret
      secretRef:
        namespace: crossplane-system
        name: azure-secret
        key: creds
  ```

  **Managed Resources**
  A managed resource (MR) represents an external service in a Provider. When users create a new managed resource, the Provider reacts by creating an external resource inside the Providerâ€™s environment. Every external service managed by Crossplane maps to a managed resource.

  ```
  apiVersion: azure.upbound.io/v1beta1
  kind: ResourceGroup
  metadata:
    name: rg-ucp-crossplane-learn
    namespace: ucplearn
    annotations:
      provider.platform.volvocars.com/external-name: azure-resourcegroup
  spec:
    forProvider:
      location: West Europe
      tags:
        provisioner: crossplane
        application: ucplearn
    # the spec.providerConfigRef.name must match the ProviderConfig metadata.name value.
    providerConfigRef:
      name: azure 
  ```

  **Composition**
  Compositions are a template for creating multiple managed resources as a single object.
  A Composition composes individual managed resources together into a larger, reusable, solution.
  An example Composition may combine a virtual machine, storage resources and networking policies. A Composition template links all these individual resources together.

  ```
  apiVersion: apiextensions.crossplane.io/v1
  kind: Composition
  metadata:
    name: resourcgroup.resource.platform.volvocars.com
    labels:
      crossplane.io/xrd: xresourcgroups.resource.platform.volvocars.com
      provider: azure
      version: "1.0.0"
    annotations:
      resource.platform.volvocars.com/external-name: resourcegroup
  spec:
    compositeTypeRef:
      apiVersion: resource.platform.volvocars.com/v1alpha1

            toFieldPath: metadata.name
        base: 
          apiVersion: azure.upbound.io/v1beta1
          kind: ResourceGroup
          spec:
            forProvider:
              location: West Europe
              tags:

            providerConfigRef:
              name: azure
  ```
  **Composite Resource Definition(XRD)**

  Composite resource definitions (XRDs) define the schema for a custom API.Users create composite resources (XRs) and Claims (XCs) using the API schema defined by an XRD.

  ```
  apiVersion: apiextensions.crossplane.io/v1
  kind: CompositeResourceDefinition
  metadata:
  name: xresourcgroups.resource.platform.volvocars.com
  annotations:
    resource.platform.volvocars.com/external-name: resourcegroup

                properties:
                  resourceGroupName:
                    type: string
                required:
                  - resourceGroupName

  ```   
  **Composite Resource Claim**

  ```
  apiVersion: resource.platform.volvocars.com/v1alpha1
  kind: CustomResourcGroup
  metadata:
    namespace: default
    name: claim1.xresourcgroup.resource.platform.volvocars.com
  spec:
    parameters:
      resourceGroupName: <user input: name of resource group>

  ```
